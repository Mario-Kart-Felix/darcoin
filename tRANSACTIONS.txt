Result object
Read more about result objects.

Successful result
If the result is successful, the transaction will have either a settling status, authorized status, or (if the options.submitForSettlement option was used) a submitted for settlement status.

Node.js

Copy
Copied
result.success;
// true

result.transaction.status;
// "authorized"
result.success;
// true

result.transaction.status;
// "authorized"
Additionally, you may inspect the result to determine if the transaction was created using a specific payment method type (e.g. PayPal account or a credit card), using the provided format.

Node.js

Copy
Copied
const transaction = result.transaction;
transaction.paymentInstrumentType === braintree.PaymentInstrumentTypes.PayPalAccount;
// false
transaction.paymentInstrumentType === braintree.PaymentInstrumentTypes.CreditCard;
// true
const transaction = result.transaction;
transaction.paymentInstrumentType === braintree.PaymentInstrumentTypes.PayPalAccount;
// false
transaction.paymentInstrumentType === braintree.PaymentInstrumentTypes.CreditCard;
// true
Unsuccessful result
Success will return false if:

Validations prevent the transaction from being created
The processor declines the authorization or settlement
The gateway rejects the transaction
Node.js

Copy
Copied
result.success;
// false

result.errors.deepErrors();
result.success;
// false

result.errors.deepErrors();
Validation errors
If any parameters are invalid, then the success call will return false and the result object will contain one or more validation errors indicating which parameters were invalid.

When receiving a validation error, a Transaction object will not be present on the result object.

Processor declined
If the processor declines the transaction during the authorization, the processor response will be available on the transaction object.

Node.js

Copy
Copied
result.success;
// false

result.transaction.status;
// "processor_declined"

result.transaction.processorResponseType;
// e.g. "soft_declined"

result.transaction.processorResponseCode;
// e.g. "2001"

result.transaction.processorResponseText;
// e..g "Insufficient Funds"
As a supplement to the standardized processor response codes, we will return bank-specific Additional Processor Responses on the transaction object. The standardized code is what you should use when handling the result object, but the Additional Processor Response might provide further context.

Node.js

Copy
Copied
result.transaction.additionalProcessorResponse;
# e.g. "05 : NOT AUTHORISED"
result.transaction.additionalProcessorResponse;
# e.g. "05 : NOT AUTHORISED"
Processor settlement declined
If the processor declines the transaction at the settlement stage, the processor response will be available on the transaction object.

Node.js

Copy
Copied
result.success;
// false

result.transaction.status;
// "settlement_declined"

result.transaction.processorSettlementResponseCode;
// e.g. "4001"

Gateway rejection
If the transaction is rejected by the gateway based on your account settings, you can check for the transaction status and gateway rejection reason.

Node.js

Copy
Copied
result.success;
// false

result.transaction.status;
// "gateway_rejected"

result.transaction.gatewayRejectionReason;
// e.g. "cvv"
result.success;
// false

result.transaction.status;
// "gateway_rejected"

result.transaction.gatewayRejectionReason;
// e.g. "cvv"
Risk data
We will also return any applicable risk data on transactions. The data includes the risk identifier, the device data captured flag, and the risk decision, which can provide further context on how a transaction was scored by Braintree.

Node.js

Copy
Copied
result.transaction.riskData.id;
// "1SG23YHM4BT5"
result.transaction.riskData.decision;
// "Decline"
result.transaction.riskData.deviceDataCaptured;
// true
result.transaction.riskData.id;
// "1SG23YHM4BT5"
result.transaction.riskData.decision;
// "Decline"
result.transaction.riskData.deviceDataCaptured;
// true
The possible values of the risk decision are:

"Not Evaluated"
"Approve"
"Review"
"Decline"
Params retrieval

Examples
Currencies
Each merchant account can only process transactions for a single currency. Setting which merchant account to use will also determine which currency the transaction is processed with.

Node.js

Copy
Copied
result.transaction.currencyIsoCode;
// USD
result.transaction.currencyIsoCode;
// USD
Settlement status
Check the result for success, and if it has failed, then first check for validation errors. If there are no validation errors, inspect the processorSettlementResponseCode on the transaction, which will indicate if the processor declined the request.

Voiding settlement
If you submit a transaction for settlement and then decide you actually don't want to settle it, you can void it before it's settled. After it's settled, you'll need to refund it instead.

To check if the transaction has been settled, find the transaction and check the status.

Network response codes
In addition to the processor response code and text, some transaction and verification objects also include a network response code and text.

These network response values are the raw responses that may be returned by the card network, and when present they can provide additional detail about why a request was approved or declined. However, this information is supplemental to the processor response code; you should consider the processor response code to be the source of truth.
